First of all I just want to congratulate the entire [Astro](https://astro.build) community for all their hard work and dedication to the project and for finally reaching V1.0!

If you have read my first blog post you might remember that I started out using Astro for this blog at first
however due to some beta issues with Astro and me wanting to learn more svelte, I remade it in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

Now Astro has released their [V1.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-1/)
I once again got excited about the project and decided to give it another go!

## So what is Astro?

Many of you might not even have heard about Astro before,
but I will explain the core concept here.

Astro is a <ToolTip description="Static Site Generator">SSG</ToolTip> that allows you to use
all the normal frameworks you're used to, such as Svelte, React, Vue, and more.

However, what's special about Astro is that by default it ships your website with
**zero** javascript. This means for example that if you have a svelte component,
any smart/interactive functionality will be disabled, Astro renders your component to html
on the server and then ships that.

For components where you need javascript on the client side, you can enable so for only
that component. By doing this on a component by component basis we can end up
with very performant websites.

## Getting started

The [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started) are amazing and will probably
provide you with a better getting started guide than this article.

I'm instead going to go more into my specific setup and how it works in this article.
